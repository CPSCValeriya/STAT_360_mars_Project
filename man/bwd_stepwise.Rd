\title{Backwards Stepwise}
\usage{
bwd_stepwise(fwd, control)
}
\arguments{
\item{fwd}{output created by running fwd_stepwise}

\item{control}{mars.control object, created with mars.control}
}
\value{
A list with elements: y, B, Bfuncs
\item{y}{the same vector of response values given as input}
\item{B}{final set of basis functions generated from the input}
\item{Bfuncs}{summary of the basis functions as a product of functions. Contains the information for the knot, variable, and sign}
}
\description{
Implements the Backwards Stepwise algorithm (Algorithm
3 from page 17 of the Friedman paper) which combats overfitting of the forward stepwise algorithm by removing redundant basis functions until the generalized cross-validation criterion is satisfied.
